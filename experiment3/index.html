				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>
					I am trying to make 2 generative worlds using autotiling and a grid layout. I also made it so that the user can edit the text to change how
					the world would look like. The user can toggle between these two worlds using the "Switch Mode" button. Each world is procedurally generated
					and "visually styled" to match its theme. I just used a few tiles here and there from the tileset provided. Every reseed produces a new layout
					of rooms and hallways if in the dungeon or terrain if in the overworld.
				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>
					This project was created using the p5.js library but worked on in VS Code. A tileset image is used to render different tile types, with each tile drawn using the
					placeTile() function.

					In dungeon mode, the grid is generated by placing rectangular rooms and connecting them with hallways. Tiles are categorized as "." (floor) or "_" (wall),
					and visuals are randomly selected from a predefined dungeonLookup object.

					In overworld mode, Perlin noise drives the biome generation, with each tile labeled "g" (grass), "w" (water), or "t" (tree), and visuals drawn
					from an overworldLookup.

					For giving the world a sense of life, the dungeon has a glow effect and you can interact with it using the mouse cursor. 
					On the other hand, a pulsing water overlay was used to represent the shimmering of the body of water. It's animated based on time.

					As mentioned before, there's a "Switch Mode" button to switch between the dungeon and overworld respectively. There's a "Reseed" button that regenerates the 
					worlds with a new seed and therefore a new layout. There's also a text box that allows direct editing of the grid using ASCII characters.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>
					One of the most enjoyable parts of this project was balancing two contrasting aesthetics using the same tileset. However, I admit I did not put more effort into
					making the dungeon look better visually. Right now, it only represents the rooms and corridors. 

					I learned a lot about modular design and conditional rendering. I had trouble separating the behavior and look of each world. There was a lot of debugging. I
					also learned new functions that help with giving the world life-like visuals.
