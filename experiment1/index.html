				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p> 
					My first experiment is a simple interactive baby name generator that suggests a name based on the perceived or desired gender of a baby. 
					You can click the "Gimme more" button to generate new suggestions, which randomly inserts male, female, or unisex baby names into a pre-written template. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>
					The project is built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic. 
					A template string contains placeholders like <code>$male_baby</code>, <code>$female_baby</code>, and <code>$unisex_baby</code>. These placeholders are replaced by randomly selected names from predefined arrays.
					jQuery to handle the button click event. When the "Gimme more" button is clicked, the <code>generate()</code> function replaces the placeholders with actual names and updates the content of the <code>#box</code> div.
					Each name type is styled with a different color using inline <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>	
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>
					Honestly this is my first time doing any sort of web dev so I was learning a lot from this. 
					One challenge was figuring out how to replace multiple placeholders within a single template and apply different styles to them. 
					There's still a visual bug when you make it fullscreen which I don't know how to solve yet. 
					I learned how to integrate jQuery for user interaction and use regular expressions for text replacement.
					Overall, this experiment was a good start on my web dev journey. I am taking notice of the connection between structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) in web development.
