				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					In this experiment, I wanted to create a an animated landscape inspired by the solar system. 
					The scene features the sun at the center with the planets orbiting around it, mimicking orbital dynamics. 
					For this experiment, I explored how movement, visual layering, and randomness could bring the still image to life. 
					I also added randomly placed stars in the background and included a button that re-randomizes their position and size.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used p5.js for my experiment. I first placed the sun in the middle with a dark blue background. Then I made the rest of the planets 
					and created an array that contains properties that would be essential for the orbit animations. To help visualize the path each planet
					was going to take, I made dashed lines to represent the orbit path. For random generation, I created the stars and there's a button on
					top that changes the position and size of the start using random seeds to simulate a change in composition upon pressing the button.
					For interactivity, I made it so that the planets move in the opposite direction of its orbit path if the mouse cursor "collides" with or
					hovers on the planet. 
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project helped me understand the fundamentals of generative art and interactivity using p5.js. One challenge I encountered was dealing
					with layout and layering issues in HTML and CSS. I had problems figuring out the cause of the overlap on the canvas. To be more specific, the 
					experiment was overlapping with the reference image. So I learned how to properly parent the canvas to a container. I also enjoyed adding motion
					to the planets and discovering how subtle touches (like orbit rings or hover interactions) make the experience more immersive. I spent the majority
					of my time figuring out how to have the planets orbit around the sun. Overall, this was a fun and rewarding experiment that combined animation, 
					interaction, and design in a way that helped solidify my understanding of generative environments.
