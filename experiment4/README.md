# Infinite Worlds â€“ Assignment 4 (CMPM 147) Artist Statement

This project explores **infinite scrolling worlds** with **variation in space, key, and signs of life** using the p5.js library.  
Three different ideas were developed to demonstrate these concepts.

## ðŸ“œ Ideas Implemented

### 1. Biome Change
- **Infinity**: Use arrow keys to scroll infinitely across the world.
- **Variation in Space**: As you move, the biome changes between Grass, Desert, and Stone.
- **Variation in Key**: Different keys create different biome layouts relative to the origin.
- **Signs of Life**: Different objects are placed on top of the tile in their respective biome. 
### 2. Snowmen
- **Infinity**: Use arrow keys to scroll infinitely across the world.
- **Variation in Space**: Snowmen are placed throughout the landscape as you move.
- **Variation in Key**: Changing the seed key will reposition the snowmen differently.
- **Signs of Life**: Clicking on a snowman throws a snowball at it, adding interactivity (a sign of life).

### 3. Growing Sunflowers
- **Infinity**: Use arrow keys to scroll infinitely through grassy fields.
- **Variation in Space**: Endless grasslands, slightly different every time.
- **Variation in Key**: Different seeds slightly adjust grass shading and reset sunflowers.
- **Signs of Life**: Clicking on empty tiles grows animated sunflowers with varied colors that spin when fully grown.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Notes
- I worked directly on my personal portfolio page using the p5.js library instead of Glitch.com.
- Therefore, I do not have a Glitch project link to submit.
