                    <p>
                        3 projects: Rolling Hills, Find the Snowman, and Plant Seeds
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Rolling Hills, players can move around a procedurally generated infinite world filled with 3 different biomes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Find the Snowman, users can move around the world to search for Snowmen. They can also click on the snowman to throw a snowball at it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Plant Seeds, users can move around to see nothing but grasslands. Users can click on any tile to plant a sunflower and watch it grow. 
                        Sunflowers come in a wide variety of randomly generated colors, adding vibrant diversity to the landscape.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tile under the mouse is highlighted to make interaction clearer, and players can toggle the screen lock
                        feature to prevent page scrolling while navigating the world with arrow keys.
                    </p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
                    This project uses <strong>p5.js</strong> to render an infinite, tile-based world.
                    Tile colors are procedurally generated with noise to create natural variation.
                    Mouse interactions allow users to interact with the world to mark tiles, throw snowballs, or plant seeds that grow 
                    over time into animated sunflowers (using easing functions for smooth transitions). Flower colors are randomized across 
                    the full color spectrum instead of a fixed palette, adding generative unpredictability. 
                    A screen lock system was implemented to prevent page scrolling when controlling the world with the keyboard.
                </p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
                    It was greatly satisfying for me to see my project work. I spent a fair bit of time getting it to work. But after creating the first
                    idea, it was relatively simple to revamp it into my other ideas. I struggled most with the interactivity of each world. I didn't do much
                    for the first idea but I started focusing more on it for the rest of the project. Overall, though not as creative as others, I believe
                    I did a lot for this project. 
                </p>
